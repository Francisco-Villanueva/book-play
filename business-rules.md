# Business Rules Documentation

## 📋 Overview

This document defines the mandatory business rules that govern the system's behavior, independent of technology implementation.

## 🎯 General Principles

1. **No booking overlap**: No two active reservations can exist for the same court at the same time
2. **Dynamic availability**: Availability is calculated in real-time, not stored as fixed slots
3. **Predictable rules**: System behavior must be consistent and predictable
4. **Exceptions take priority**: ExceptionRules always override AvailabilityRules
5. **Simplicity over flexibility**: Simple, clear rules over complex edge cases (for MVP)

---

## 📅 Booking Rules

### BR-001: No Overlapping Reservations
**Rule**: Two active bookings cannot overlap on the same court.

**Validation**: Must be enforced at all times, regardless of who creates the booking (user, admin, API).

**Example**:
```
Court A - Monday 18:00-19:00 → Booking exists
Court A - Monday 18:30-19:30 → ❌ REJECTED (overlaps)
Court A - Monday 19:00-20:00 → ✅ ALLOWED (no overlap)
```

### BR-002: Booking States
**Rule**: A booking can only be in one of two states:
- `ACTIVE`: Blocks the time slot
- `CANCELLED`: Does not block availability

**Behavior**:
- Cancelled bookings are ignored in availability calculations
- Cancellation is permanent (no "undo" in MVP)

### BR-003: Booking Creation Validation
**Rule**: Bookings can only be created in available time slots.

**Requirements**:
1. Time slot must exist in AvailabilityRule OR ExceptionRule
2. No active booking exists for that slot
3. Court must exist and belong to the business
4. User must have permission (if authenticated)

### BR-004: Booking Duration
**Rule**: Booking duration is defined by the system configuration, not user input.

**MVP Behavior**: Fixed duration per business (e.g., 60-minute slots).

**Future**: Variable duration based on court type or user preference.

### BR-005: Guest Bookings
**Rule**: Bookings can be created without a registered user account.

**Requirements** (for guest bookings):
- Name (required)
- Phone or Email (at least one required)
- No user authentication

**Limitations**:
- Cannot view booking history
- Cannot manage bookings (admin must cancel)

---

## ⏰ Availability Rules

### BR-006: Base Availability Definition
**Rule**: Availability is defined through recurring weekly patterns (AvailabilityRule).

**Pattern**: Days of week + time ranges
```
Example:
- Monday-Friday: 18:00-23:00
- Saturday-Sunday: 10:00-22:00
```

**Note**: Availability is NOT stored as individual time slots but calculated dynamically.

### BR-007: Exception Priority
**Rule**: ExceptionRules ALWAYS take precedence over AvailabilityRules.

**Priority Order**:
1. ExceptionRule (highest)
2. AvailabilityRule
3. Existing Bookings

**Example**:
```
Base rule: Monday 18:00-23:00 available
Exception: Monday 2024-12-25 CLOSED
Result: Monday 2024-12-25 → No availability (even though it's a Monday)
```

### BR-008: Exception Types
**Rule**: Exceptions can either BLOCK or ENABLE time slots.

**Block Exception**:
- Removes availability (e.g., holiday closure)
- Overrides base availability

**Enable Exception**:
- Adds availability outside normal hours
- Useful for special events

**Example**:
```
Base: Wednesday CLOSED
Enable Exception: Wednesday 2024-12-20 10:00-14:00 OPEN
Result: Only 10:00-14:00 available on that specific Wednesday
```

### BR-009: No Availability Without Rules
**Rule**: A court with no AvailabilityRule assigned is NOT bookable.

**Behavior**: Courts must explicitly define when they're available.

---

## 🏟️ Court Rules

### BR-010: Court Ownership
**Rule**: Each court belongs to exactly one business.

**Constraints**:
- Cannot share courts between businesses
- Cannot transfer courts (delete and recreate instead, for MVP)

### BR-011: Shared Availability Rules
**Rule**: Multiple courts can share the same AvailabilityRule.

**Benefits**:
- Avoid duplicate configuration
- Update multiple courts at once

**Example**:
```
5 soccer courts with same schedule:
- Create 1 AvailabilityRule
- Assign to all 5 courts
- Changing the rule affects all courts
```

**Important**: Changes to shared rules do NOT affect existing bookings.

### BR-012: Custom Court Rules
**Rule**: Courts can have their own specific AvailabilityRules.

**Use Case**: When one court has different hours than others.

---

## 👥 User & Permission Rules

### BR-013: Role-Based Access Control
**Rule**: User permissions are determined by their BusinessUser role within each business.

**Global Roles** (User.globalRole):
- `MASTER`: SaaS admin, can audit all businesses
- `PLAYER`: Regular user, can make bookings

**Business Roles** (BusinessUser.role):
- `OWNER`: Full control, billing access, can delete business
- `ADMIN`: Manage courts, schedules, bookings (no billing)
- `STAFF`: View agenda, create/cancel bookings only

### BR-014: Multi-Business Users
**Rule**: A user can have different roles in different businesses.

**Example**:
```
User: Juan
- Complex A: OWNER
- Complex B: STAFF
- Complex C: PLAYER (just books courts)
```

### BR-015: Permission Inheritance
**Rule**: Higher roles include all permissions of lower roles.

**Hierarchy**:
```
OWNER > ADMIN > STAFF
```

**Example**: An OWNER can do everything an ADMIN can do, plus more.

### BR-016: Player Booking Permissions
**Rule**: Any authenticated user can book courts as a PLAYER, regardless of admin roles.

**Behavior**: Having an ADMIN role in one business doesn't prevent booking as a player in another.

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Rules

### BR-017: Business Isolation
**Rule**: Data from one business is completely isolated from others.

**Enforced At**:
- Database level (business_id foreign keys)
- API level (permission checks)
- UI level (filtered queries)

### BR-018: No Cross-Business Operations
**Rule**: Actions in one business cannot affect another.

**Examples**:
- Bookings only visible within the business
- Rules only apply to courts in the same business
- Users in one business cannot see users in another (unless they belong to both)

---

## 🚫 MVP Simplifications

These rules are simplified for the MVP and will be enhanced in future versions:

### BR-019: No Cancellation Penalties
**Rule**: Cancelling a booking has no penalty or restrictions.

**Future**: Add cancellation policies, deadlines, or fees.

### BR-020: No Payment Integration
**Rule**: Booking confirmation does not require payment.

**Future**: Integrate online payments, deposits, or "pay at venue" tracking.

### BR-021: No Recurring Bookings
**Rule**: Each booking is a single, independent reservation.

**Future**: Allow users to book the same slot weekly/monthly.

### BR-022: No Advanced User Rules
**Rule**: All users are treated equally (no VIP, no blacklist).

**Future**: Priority booking, user tiers, loyalty programs.

### BR-023: No Midnight-Crossing Bookings
**Rule**: Bookings cannot start on one day and end on the next.

**Future**: Support overnight bookings if needed.

### BR-024: Single Exception Per Day (MVP)
**Rule**: Only one ExceptionRule can apply to a given date per court.

**Future**: Support multiple exceptions with conflict resolution.

## ⚠️ Critical Validations

These validations MUST be enforced in the backend:

1. ✅ No overlapping active bookings

3. ✅ Exception priority over availability
4. ✅ User has required permission for action
5. ✅ Court belongs to the correct business
6. ✅ Cancelled bookings don't block slots
7. ✅ Guest bookings have required contact info
8. ✅ Times don't cross midnight (MVP)
